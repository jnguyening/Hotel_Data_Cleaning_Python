# Hotel Booking Data Cleaning with Python

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **cleaning hotel booking data** using Python to prepare it for analysis. The dataset, sourced from [Kaggleâ€™s Hotel Booking Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand), contains detailed information about bookings made at city and resort hotels, including reservation status, customer demographics, lead times, and cancellation patterns. The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing categorical variables. This project demonstrates how to transform raw hospitality data into a clean, structured format suitable for analytics and modeling.
